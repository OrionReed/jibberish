export const NIETZSCHE = `After such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be heard it appeals to the most serious minds Take care ye philosophers and friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom Of suffering for the truths sake even in your own defense It spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even worse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earthas though the Truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors and you of all people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance Messrs Loafers and Cobwebspinners of the spirit Finally ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and lawcourts Rather go out of the way Flee into concealment And have your masks and your ruses that ye may be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared And pray dont forget the garden the garden with golden trelliswork And have people around you who are as a gardenor as music on the waters at eventide when already the day becomes a memory Choose the GOOD solitude the free wanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever How poisonous how crafty how bad does every long war make one which cannot be waged openly by means of force How PERSONAL does a long fear make one a long watching of enemies of possible enemies These pariahs of society these longpursued badlypersecuted onesalso the compulsory recluses the Spinozas or Giordano Brunosalways become in the end even under the most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware of it refined vengeanceseekers and poisonBrewers just lay bare the foundation of Spinozas ethics and theology not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him The martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a martyr into a stageandtribunebawler Only that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any casemerely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the continued proof that the long real tragedy IS AT AN END supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy where he is FREE from the crowd the many the majoritywhere he may forget men who are the rule as their exceptionexclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense Whoever in intercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes supposing however that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains as I said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then certain he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge For as such he would one day have to say to himself The devil take my good taste but the rule is more interesting than the exceptionthan myself the exception And he would go DOWN and above all he would go inside The long and serious study of the AVERAGE manand consequently much disguise selfovercoming familiarity and bad intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with ones equalsthat constitutes a necessary part of the lifehistory of every philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing part If he is fortunate however as a favourite child of knowledge should be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task I mean socalled cynics those who simply recognize the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSESsometimes they wallow even in books as on their own dunghill Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him or the scientific satyr speaks out There are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgustnamely where by a freak of nature genius is bound to some such indiscreet billygoat and ape as in the case of the Abbe Galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also filthiest man of his centuryhe was far profounder than Voltaire and consequently also a good deal more silent It happens more frequently as has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an apes body a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no means rare especially among doctors and moral physiologists And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man as a belly with two requirements and a head with one whenever any one sees seeks and WANTS to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions in short when any one speaks badlyand not even illof man then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation For the indignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and selfsatisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary more indifferent and less instructive case And no one is such a LIAR as the indignant man It is difficult to be understood especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati Footnote Like the river Ganges presto among those only who think and live otherwisenamely kurmagati Footnote Like the tortoise lento or at best froglike mandeikagati Footnote Like the frog staccato I do everything to be difficultly understood myselfand one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation As regards the good friends however who are always too easygoing and think that as friends they have a right to ease one does well at the very first to grant them a playground and rompingplace for misunderstandingone can thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good friendsand laugh then also What is most difficult to render from one language into another is the TEMPO of its style which has its basis in the character of the race or to speak more physiologically in the average TEMPO of the assimilation of its nutriment There are honestly meant translations which as involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of the original merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression could not also be rendered A German is almost incapacitated for presto in his language consequently also as may be reasonably inferred for many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free freespirited thought And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him Everything ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all longwinded and wearying species of style are developed in profuse variety among Germanspardon me for stating the fact that even Goethes prose in its mixture of stiffness and elegance is no exception as a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs and as an expression of German taste at a time when there was still a German taste which was a rococotaste in moribus et artibus Lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and was versed in many things he who was not the translator of Bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire and still more willingly among the Roman comedywritersLessing loved also freespiritism in the tempo and flight out of Germany But how could the German language even in the prose of Lessing imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli who in his Principe makes us breathe the dry fine air of Florence and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to presentlong heavy difficult dangerous thoughts and a TEMPO of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour Finally who would venture on a German translation of Petronius who more than any great musician hitherto was a master of PRESTO in invention ideas and words What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick evil world or of the ancient world when like him one has the feet of a wind the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which makes everything healthy by making everything RUN And with regard to Aristophanesthat transfiguring complementary genius for whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed provided one has understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATOS secrecy and sphinxlike nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his deathbed there was found no Bible nor anything Egyptian Pythagorean or Platonicbut a book of Aristophanes How could even Plato have endured lifea Greek life which he repudiatedwithout an Aristophanes It is the business of the very few to be independent it is a privilege of the strong And whoever attempts it even with the best right but without being OBLIGED to do so proves that he is probably not only strong but also daring beyond measure He enters into a labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience Supposing such a one comes to grief it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize with it And he cannot any longer go back He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men`;
